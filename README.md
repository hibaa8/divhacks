# fabrich - Project for Columbia DivHacks Hackathon 2024
fabrich is an app that connects individuals seeking sustainable fashion options by providing a curated space to discover eco-friendly clothing choices, tracks sustainability scores, and lets users share their virtual sustainable closet.
Enter a URL for a product, and:
1. it provides a sustainability score out of 10
2. presents 3-5 alternative items that are more sustainable, based on factors like fabric type, product description, and price range
3. curates feed based on a recommendation system
4. adds purchased items to virtual closet, and adds cumulative sustainability score to profile

Note: project is currently in-progress (will be completed post-hackathon)
